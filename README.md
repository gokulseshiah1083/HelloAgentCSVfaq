# HelloAgentCSVfaq
Creating a test agent for CSV processing and chat responses using streamlit.

**Chat With Your CSV
A Streamlit and LangChain Tutorial**

This document explains everything you need to run and understand the project.
It covers setup, how the app works, and how to use it with your own CSV files.

**1. Project Overview
This project is a simple web app that lets you talk to your CSV files in normal language.
**
You can

Upload one or many CSV files through a Streamlit user interface
Ask questions in normal language such as
What is the return policy
How long does standard shipping take
What does the extended warranty cover
Show complaints about delivery
Get answers from the actual data in the CSV files, not from general knowledge
The app uses

Streamlit for the user interface
Pandas to load and work with CSV data
LangChain to create a data frame agent
OpenAI chat model to reason about the data and answer questions
The goal is to keep the project simple and easy to understand
There is no vector database and no advanced retrieval
The model uses the LangChain data frame agent to inspect the data and reply from it

**2. Technology Stack
The project uses the following main tools and libraries**

Python
Streamlit for the web app
Pandas for CSV handling
LangChain core package
LangChain OpenAI integration
LangChain experimental agents for data frame agent support
OpenAI chat model (for example gpt 4o mini)
Tabulate library for neat table formatting in the background
Python packages are listed in requirements.txt:

streamlit
pandas
langchain
langchain-openai
langchain-experimental
openai
tabulate

**3. Folder Structure
You can keep the project in a simple folder such as**

chat-with-csv/
  Hello_Agent_CSV_Faq.py
  requirements.txt
  credit_card_terms.csv
  ecommerce_faqs.csv
  hospital_policy.csv
  saas_docs.csv
  README.md
You can add more CSV files to test other use cases

**4. Prerequisites
Before you install and run the project, make sure you have**

Python 3.13 or later
pip to install Python packages
A valid OpenAI API key
You do not need any database or extra storage

**5. Installation**
Follow these steps in order

5.1 Clone or create the project folder
If you already have the files, place them in a folder If you use git, you can clone your own repository

mkdir chat-with-csv
cd chat-with-csv
# copy Hello_Agent_CSV_Faq.py, requirements.txt and CSV files into this folder
5.2 Create a virtual environment (recommended)
On most systems you can do

python -m venv venv
Activate the environment

On Windows

venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS or Linux

source venv/bin/activate
5.3 Install dependencies
Run

pip install -r requirements.txt
This installs Streamlit, Pandas, LangChain and OpenAI related packages

6. OpenAI API Key Setup
There are two options

Option 1 use the text box in the sidebar
The current app already asks for the OpenAI API key in the sidebar

Start the app
Go to the left sidebar
Paste your OpenAI API key in the field
The key is used only in your session by the app
This is the simplest way and matches the current Hello_Agent_CSV_Faq.py file

Option 2 set an environment variable (optional)
If you prefer not to paste the key each time, you can export it as an environment variable

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Then you can change the code to read from the environment At the moment the code reads it from the Streamlit sidebar, so this is optional

7. Running the App
Once you have installed the dependencies and prepared your API key

Make sure your virtual environment is active

In the project folder run

streamlit run Hello_Agent_CSV_Faq.py
Streamlit will start a local server and open a browser window Usually the address looks like http://localhost:8501

You should see

A sidebar with configuration and instructions
A main page with the title Chat with your CSVs (natural language)
A file upload area
A text box for your questions
8. Understanding Hello_Agent_CSV_Faq.py Step by Step
This section explains what the main script does

8.1 Page configuration
st.set_page_config(page_title="Chat with CSV", page_icon="📊", layout="wide")
This line sets the title, emoji icon and layout for the Streamlit page

8.2 Sidebar layout
Inside the sidebar the app

Shows a small icon
Displays a title
Asks the user for the OpenAI API key
Shows a small description of the technology stack
Shows basic instructions
Key part

openai_api_key = st.text_input(
    "OpenAI API Key",
    type="password",
    help="Enter your OpenAI API key here."
)
If the user does not enter a key, the app cannot call the OpenAI model

8.3 Main title and description
st.title("📊 Chat with your CSVs (natural language)")
st.write(
    "Upload CSV files and ask questions in normal language. "
    "The AI will look inside the tables and answer using the actual data."
)
This tells the user what the app does

8.4 File uploader
uploaded_files = st.file_uploader(
    "Upload CSV files",
    type=["csv"],
    accept_multiple_files=True
)
The user can upload one or many CSV files at the same time Each uploaded file is read into a Pandas data frame later

8.5 Reading the CSV files
If both uploaded_files and openai_api_key are present, the app

Loops through each uploaded file
Reads it into a Pandas data frame
Shows the first three rows of each data frame in a separate column
for i, file in enumerate(uploaded_files):
    df = pd.read_csv(file)
    dfs.append(df)
    df_names.append(file.name)

    with cols[i % len(cols)]:
        st.write(f"**{file.name}**")
        st.dataframe(df.head(3))
This gives a quick preview so the user knows which files were loaded

8.6 Building a summary of the data frames
The app prepares a short summary that lists each file and its first few column names

summaries = []
for name, df in zip(df_names, dfs):
    cols_sample = [str(c) for c in df.columns[:15]]
    summaries.append(f"- File: '{name}' | Columns: {', '.join(cols_sample)}")
df_summary_text = "\n".join(summaries)
This text is passed into the system prompt so the model knows which columns exist in which file

8.7 System prompt for strict data use
The app builds a very clear instruction block called system_prompt

This prompt tells the model

Always inspect the data frames using Pandas before answering

Never answer from general knowledge

Never answer with phrases such as “it is in column X”

For text questions

Search string columns for relevant rows
If a column named Answer, Policy, Description or similar exists, use it as the main answer
Return cell text from the best matching row or rows
For numeric questions

Use Pandas operations such as sum, mean, groupby and similar
Answer in plain English and quote real values from the data

This is the heart of the logic It keeps the model honest and tied to the CSV files

8.8 Creating the LangChain data frame agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    temperature=0.0,
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    openai_api_key=openai_api_key
)

agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(
    llm,
    dfs,
    verbose=True,
    agent_type="openai-functions",
    allow_dangerous_code=True
)
Explanation

ChatOpenAI creates an OpenAI chat model client
create_pandas_dataframe_agent wraps this model in an agent that knows how to work with Pandas data frames
The list dfs contains all data frames created from the uploaded CSV files
verbose=True lets you see intermediate agent logs in the Streamlit terminal
agent_type="openai-functions" uses the OpenAI function style agent for safer call structure
8.9 Question input and answer step
The user types a question

user_question = st.text_input(
    "Example: 'what is the return policy', 'total sales for 2023', 'show all delayed shipments'"
)
When the user submits a question

The app concatenates the system prompt and the user question into final_query
It sends this query to the agent
The agent uses the model plus Pandas tools to inspect the data frames and returns an answer
final_query = (
    system_prompt
    + "\n\nNow answer this question using the DataFrames only:\n"
    + user_question
)
response = agent.run(final_query)
The answer is displayed as Markdown in the app

If something breaks, the app shows an error message using st.error

9. Sample CSV Files Provided
9.1 credit_card_terms.csv

9.2 ecommerce_faqs.csv

9.3 hospital_policy.csv

9.4 saas_docs.csv

10. How to Use the App Step by Step
Start the app with streamlit run Hello_Agent_CSV_Faq.py

In the sidebar paste your OpenAI API key

Use the upload area to select one or more CSV files

3.1 You can use the provided sample files or your own

Check the preview tables to confirm that the data loaded correctly

Scroll down to the question box

Type a question in normal language

For example

“What is the return policy for electronics”
“Explain the foreign transaction fee for all cards”
“What does the extended warranty cover”
Press Enter

Wait for the spinner to finish

Read the AI response under “AI Response”

If the question matches the data properly, the answer will quote the real cell values If the agent cannot find anything, it may explain that no matching rows were found

11. Customization Ideas
You can extend the project in many ways

Add more CSV files for other domains such as HR policies, company internal FAQs or product catalogs
Change the system prompt to enforce a different style of answer
Switch to a different OpenAI model by changing the model parameter in ChatOpenAI
Add caching or logging of questions and answers
Add file type filters to group certain CSV files by domain
All of these changes can be done inside Hello_Agent_CSV_Faq.py
